<strong>Waiver of Liability</strong>

<p>This agreement releases MAGFest, Inc., MAGStock and all directors, employees, agents, and affiliates (collectively “MAGFest”) from all liability relating to injuries that may occur during the course of the MAGStock outdoor camping event. By signing this agreement, I agree to hold MAGFest entirely free from any liability, including financial responsibility for any injuries incurred, regardless of whether injuries are caused by negligence.</p>

<p>I also acknowledge the risks involved in camping outdoors and attending a music festival, including participating in potentially strenuous or dangerous physical activities, swimming without a lifeguard on watch, being exposed to flashing lights and loud music, and being exposed to heat and inclement weather. I swear that I am participating voluntarily, and that all risks have been made clear to me. Additionally, I do not have any conditions that will increase my likelihood of experiencing injuries while engaging in this activity.</p>

<p>By signing below I forfeit all right to bring a suit against MAGFest for any reason. In return, I will be able to participate in all MAGStock activities, and be granted access to the amenities of the host venue. I will also make every effort to obey safety precautions as listed in writing and as explained to me verbally. I will ask for clarification when needed.</p>

<p>By signing, I fully understand and agree to the above terms.</p>
