<strong>Waiver of Liability</strong>

<p>I am requesting to be allowed to attend and participate in the MAGStock-branded events (such events, collectively, “<b>MAGStock</b>”) sponsored or offered by MAGFest, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“<b>MAGFest</b>”).  MAGStock is intended to involve camping outdoors and attending a music festival, which may include participating in potentially strenuous or dangerous physical activities, such as swimming without a lifeguard on watch, being exposed to flashing lights and loud music, and being exposed to heat and inclement weather.  I also understand that fellow participants may initiate or organize activities during MAGStock that have not been vetted or approved by MAGFest, and that this waiver and release of liability also covers such unsanctioned activities.  I am aware that the MAGSTock events, in which I desire to participate, can be of an extremely strenuous nature that can/may exceed the limits of my physical abilities.  I understand that my attendance at or participation in MAGStock, or any activities related to or contemporaneous with MAGStock (whether or not organized, sanctioned or vetted by MAGFest) is expressly conditioned upon my execution and agreement with this Waiver and Release of Liability (this “<b>Agreement</b>”).</p>

<p><b>Express assumption of risk.</b> I, the undersigned, recognize and understand that the programs, classes, and activities (whether organized by MAGFest or otherwise) in which I may choose to participate during MAGStock are not without varying degrees of risk of physical harm, which may include, but are not limited to the following: muscle soreness; minor aches and pains; tiredness; stiff joints and muscles; tearing of muscles, ligaments, and/or tissue, bone tearing or breakage, serious bodily injury or death. I also understand that injuries or damage may occur due to negligence on the part of myself, the MAGStock staff, or other people around me.</p>

<p>I willingly and voluntarily assume full responsibility for the risks that I am exposing myself to and accept full responsibility for any injury or death that may result from participation in any activity while attending MAGStock.</p>

<p><b>Release</b>: In consideration of the above mentioned risks and hazards and in consideration of the fact that I am willingly and voluntarily participating in MAGStock and any related or contemporaneous activities, I, the undersigned hereby release MAGFest, and its directors, officers, principals, agents, employees, and volunteers (collectively, the “<b>MAGFest Personnel</b>”) from any and all liability, claims, demands, actions or rights of action, which are related to, arise out of, or are in any way connected with my participation in or attendance at MAGStock, including those allegedly attributed to the negligent acts or omissions of the Releasees.</p>

<p>This Agreement shall be binding upon me, my successors, representatives, heirs, executors, assigns, or transferees.  If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid, I agree that the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full legal force and effect.  I also give full permission for any person connected with MAGStock to administer first aid deemed necessary, and in case of serious illness or injury, I give permission to call for medical and or surgical care deemed necessary and to transport me to a medical facility deemed necessary for my well-being.</p>

<p><b>Indemnification & Costs</b>: I recognize that there is risk involved in the types of activities offered or that may occur at MAGStock. Therefore I accept financial responsibility for any injury that I may cause either to myself or to any other participant due to my negligence or misconduct.  I further agree to indemnify and hold harmless the MAGFest Personnel from any liability relating to or arising out of my participation in or attendance at MAGStock, including for the injury or death of any person(s) and damage to property that may result from my negligent or intentional act or failure to act.  </p>

<p>If any person or entity, or anyone acting on their behalf, reasonably incur attorney’s fees and/or other costs in connection with enforcing this Agreement, I agree to reimburse them for such fees and costs.</p>

<p><b>I have read and understood the foregoing assumption of risk, waiver, and release of liability and I understand that by signing this Agreement it obligates me to indemnify certain people in certain situations and that I am waiving valuable legal rights.</b></p>
