<h2> Dietary Restrictions </h2>

{% if attendee.badge_type == c.GUEST_BADGE %}
We feed our guests three meals per day during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, and our chefs have an easier time planning meals
when they know what kind of food restrictions everyone has.
{% else %}
Thanks for volunteering, welcome to the fold! Please let us know any dietary restrictions or allergies below.
<br/>Volunteers who have met hour requirements for food will have access to the staff grill and a refrigerator/cooler. We will provide some general group meals, but the grill will also be available for personal use.

<form method="post" action="food_restrictions">
    {{ csrf_token() }}
    <input type="hidden" name="id" value="{{ fr.db_id }}" />

    Please select any options that apply:<br/>
    <div id="restrictions">{{ macros.checkgroup(fr, 'standard') }}</div>

    <br/>
    Let us know if you have any other allergies or restrictions,
    please use commas to separate each allergy and food restriction.
    <br/><br/>Please note we are unable to accommodate every constraint, and the form below is not designed for preferences due to taste.

    <textarea name="freeform" rows="3" cols="80">{{ fr.freeform }}</textarea>

    <br/> <br/> <input type="submit" value="Save" /><br/>
    By clicking Save I agree that I have read the above information and indicated any restrictions requested.

    <br/> <br/>
    * We understand that there are different types of vegetarians/vegans, but due to the amount of food and restrictions we have to work with, we cannot accommodate all types. All vegetarian options would also be vegan.
