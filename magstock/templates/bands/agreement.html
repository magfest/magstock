    <br><br>
Alternately, performers may choose to camp in a tent, if they desire.
Air-conditioned instrument storage will still be provided.
    <br><br>
Additional space, and camping equipment will be the responsibility of the performer.

This is a requirement of the campground and non-negotiable.
