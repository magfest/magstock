    Accommodations
</h3>
    <p>

            <br>
        Cabin space is limited, so cabins may be shared between performers.

            <br>
        Additional space, and camping equipment will be the responsibility of the performer.

    <p>
        <strong>Performers <em>must</em> be free and clear of performer cabins by noon Sunday.</strong>
            <br>
        This is a requirement of the campground and non-negotiable.
