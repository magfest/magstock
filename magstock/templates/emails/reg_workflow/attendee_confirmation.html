No registration materials are physically mailed before the event, so you should check in at the registration desk when you arrive at MAGStock. Simply bring a photo ID to the registration desk, where you'll be provided with your admission wristband. If you ordered bonus items such as a t-shirt or supporter package, you can also pick those up at the registration desk. The location and hours of the registration desk will be e-mailed prior to the event.

    Your additional contribution of ${{ attendee.amount_extra|add:attendee.food_cost }} provides you with these bonuses:
    <ul>
    {% for swag in attendee.donation_swag|add:attendee.addons %}
        <li>{{ swag }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endif %}

    {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} has a no-refund policy for all registrations.  If for any reason you can't make it, we allow and encourage
    you to resell your registration for the exact price you paid for it.  To transfer your registration to another person,
    send them <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/transfer_badge?id={{ attendee.id }}">this personalized link</a>,
    which will work until {{ c.UBER_TAKEDOWN|datetime }}.
